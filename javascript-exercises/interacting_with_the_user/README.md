# Interacting with the User

At the end of the day, software is a tool for people. Lots of programs talk to
each other, but at some point or another a real person is going to interact with
the software.

The ways in which a user can interact with (give inputs to and read outputs
from) software is called the **user interface**, and it will differ depending on
the context.

For web applications, the user interface is the browser, which renders HTML with
text, graphics, and media. Before the advent of the **Graphical User
Interface**, or GUI, the only way to interact with a computer was by typing
commands into a terminal and reading the output.

We're going to explore the ways that JavaScript allows for user interaction.

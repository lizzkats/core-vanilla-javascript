# Command Line Arguments

When executing a program from the command line, most languages (including
JavaScript) provide a mechanism by which you can access the **arguments**
provided to the command.

The arguments to a command are the words provided after the command itself. In
the following example, `node` is the command, the first argument is `script.js`
and the second argument is `foo`.

```shell
$ node script.js foo # the $ is the shell prompt. Don't type it! # is a comment.
```

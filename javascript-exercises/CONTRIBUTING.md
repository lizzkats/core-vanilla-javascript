This project is a learning tool. For contributors to the baseline project, this
means:

1. Clarity is prioritized over cleverness. (Even if it's really cool!)
1. Commits are held to a high standard.
1. Project maintainers and contributors are bound by our [Code of
   Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
1. All contributions to this repository become bound by our [license](LICENSE)


### Clarity over Cleverness
When providing instruction, it's easy to fall into the "this is
really cool!" trap. Code should prioritize clarity over cleverness
in every case; and over convention in some cases.

### Commit Standards

We expect commits to:
* Be small
* Follow [Tim Pope's Guide to Commit
  Messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
  * Provide technical analysis of the code

# Introduction to Callbacks

In JavaScript, we frequently encounter functions which take other functions as
arguments. This is a powerful technique known as a "callback function". Callback
functions, also referred to as simply "callbacks", are used all over the place
in JavaScript.

Understanding how to use callback functions as well as how to write functions
that accept callback functions as arguments is critical.

These exercises are intended to get a developer comfortable with callbacks in
JavaScript.

## Let's Get Started

1. Open the first JavaScript file as noted by [the suggested
   order](00_SUGGESTED_ORDER.md).
2. Review the use cases at the bottom of the JavaScript file.
3. Uncomment the first use case and make the code work. (Frequently this means
   replacing `____`s with code of your own.)
4. Verify it works. (Run the JavaScript file with `node`.)
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until all use cases are working.
6. Repeat steps 1 to 5 until you've worked through all the JavaScript files.
7. Submit a request for feedback on your commits!
